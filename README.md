SCOPE OF CONTEST: Students will cooperatively create a new website for tularecountyhistory.org. Basic elements of this competition include background, header image, site title, font and design elements, site navigation elements, and supportive multimedia. Header may consist of a cropped image suitable for the website. Students are not required to re-create 100% of all webpage content currently housed at the existing website; however, they must provide enough content to showcase website navigation and consistent branding concepts throughout the site. Students must complete the copyrighted material permission form for entry submission, if appropriate. Students will present their website to a panel of judges explaining the software or web-based tools used in the web site creation, as well as the methods used. Only one team at a time is allowed in the judging area.
